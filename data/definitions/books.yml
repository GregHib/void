        The Shield of Arrav
  
        by A. R. Wright
  
  
  
        Arrav is probably the best
        known hero of the 4th
        age. Many legends are
        told of his heroics. One
        surviving artefact from
        the 4th age is a fabulous
        shield.
  
        This shield is believed to
        have once belonged to
        Arrav and is now indeed
        known as the Shield of
        Arrav. For over 150
        years it was the prize
        piece in the royal
        museum of Varrock.

        However, in the year 143
        of the fifth age a gang of
        thieves called the Phoenix
        Gang broke into the
        museum and stole the
        shield in a daring raid. As
        a result, the current
        ruler, King Roald, put a
        1200 gold bounty (a
        massive sum of money in
        those days) on the return
        of the shield, hoping that
        one of the culprits would
        betray his fellows out of
        greed.

        This tactic did not work
        however, and the thieves
        who stole the shield have
        since gone on to become
        the most powerful crime
        gang in Varrock, despite
        making an enemy of the
        Royal Family many
        years ago.
        
        
        The reward for the
        return of the shield still
        stands.
