## Quick setup

1. Make sure you have java 19 or above installed. (`java --version` on command line)
2. Extract the [latest void.zip released bundle](https://github.com/GregHib/void/releases) into a directory.
3. Extract the [latest pre-modified game files cache.zip](https://mega.nz/folder/ZMN2AQaZ#4rJgfzbVW0_mWsr1oPLh1A) into `/void/data/cache/`.
4. Run either the `run-server.bat` on Windows, or `run-server.sh` on Linux.
    ```
    [Main] - Void loaded in 2349ms
    [GameServer] - Listening for requests on port 43594...
    ```
   You should see these two messages followed by many `[GameLoop]` to know the server is up and running correctly.

   > Ctrl + C to exit and shutdown the server when running from a command line terminal.

5. Run the [latest client.jar](https://github.com/GregHib/void-client/releases) and login with any username and password to create a new account.

## Development

It is recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA to develop with Void.
The community edition can be downloaded for free from the [jetbrains website.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
See [the installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html) for more instructions.

Once inside the IDE, you can create a new project by going to `File | New | Project from version control... |`

Selecting `git` version control and entering the void project URL `git@github.com:GregHib/void.git` found under the `<> Code` button on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/GregHib/void).

Press clone and after a little while the project will be opened for you, the JDK indexed and gradle setup.

Extract the [cache files](https://mega.nz/folder/ZMN2AQaZ#4rJgfzbVW0_mWsr1oPLh1A) into a new directory called `/cache/` inside of the `/data/` directory.

From here you can navigate in the left panel to `/game/src/main/kotlin/world/gregs/voidps/` where you will find [Main.kt](./game/src/main/kotlin/world/gregs/voidps/Main.kt) which you should be able to right-click and run.

You can also run in the command line using the gradle wrapper.

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Once the server is up and running; setup the [void-client repository](https://github.com/GregHib/void-client/) or download one of the [prebuilt client.jars](https://github.com/GregHib/void-client/releases) and run to log into the game.

> [!TIP]
> There are instructions on how to [build your own client](https://github.com/GregHib/void/wiki/client-building) and [build your own cache](https://github.com/GregHib/void/wiki/cache-building)!
