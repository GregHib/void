## Installation

### Prerequisites

* Installed Java Development Kit (JDK) 19 or above. https://adoptium.net/en-GB/
* Downloaded the latest `client.jar` from the [client release page](https://github.com/GregHib/void-client/releases).
* Downloaded pre-modified cache game files from [cache artifacts](https://mega.nz/folder/ZMN2AQaZ#4rJgfzbVW0_mWsr1oPLh1A).

> [!TIP]
> There are instructions on how to [build your own client](https://github.com/GregHib/void/wiki/client-building) and [build your own cache](https://github.com/GregHib/void/wiki/cache-building)!

### Extract cache

Create a new folder `/cache/` inside the `/data/` directory and extract the cache files inside of it.
The files location should look like this: `/void/data/cache/main_file_cache.dat2`

### Play

To quickly launch the server to log in and play; open a terminal in the `void` directory and run the following command:

```bash
./gradlew run
```

> [!TIP]
> Ctrl + C to exit and shutdown the server when running from a command line terminal.

#### Common issues

To resolve the error

```bash
> Kotlin could not find the required JDK tools in the Java installation. Make sure Kotlin compilation is running on a JDK, not JRE.
```

Open the `gradle.properties` file, remove the hash from the first line and replace the directory with the location of
your JDK installation.

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=C:/Users/Greg/.jdks/openjdk-19.0.1/
```

### Development

It is recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA to develop with Void.
The community edition can be downloaded for free from the [jetbrains website.](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
See [the installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html) for more instructions.

Once inside the IDE, you can create a new project by going to `File | New | Project from version control... |`

Selecting `git` version control and entering the void project URL `git@github.com:GregHib/void.git` found under the `<> Code` button on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/GregHib/void).

Press clone and after a little while the project will be opened for you, the JDK indexed and gradle setup.

From here you can navigate in the left panel to `/game/src/main/kotlin/world/gregs/voidps/` where you will find [Main.kt](./game/src/main/kotlin/world/gregs/voidps/Main.kt) which you should be able to right-click and run.
