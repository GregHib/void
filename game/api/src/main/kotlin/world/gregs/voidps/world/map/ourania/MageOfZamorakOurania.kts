    npc<Shifty>("An...archeological dig. Yeah, a dig.")
    npc<Angry>("Why?")
    player<Quiz>("Next to a Chaos Altar? That's a bit odd. Can I go down and have a look?")
    npc<Uncertain>("Well...I suppose. See, we found this ancient altar, but it was pretty broken so the Z.M.I. sent some of its researchers to try and repair it.")
    player<Talk>("How'd that work out for them?")
    npc<Happy>("Pretty well - only one died. Still, they got it working...sort of. This ancient technology can be tricky.")
    player<Uncertain>("What do you mean, 'sort of'? Altars either work or don't work.")
    npc<Upset>("This one works, just not as you'd expect. You put pure essence in, but get random runes back. Some of them we don't even know how to craft!")
    player<Neutral>("Sounds like a pretty good deal. Can I give it a go?")
    npc<Afraid>("I don't think so. The mages don't like outsiders going in; they'll probably attack you. They only patrol the short path, though, so if you used the long path, through a tunnel near the entrance, you'd probably be safe.")
    player<Neutral>("Thanks.")
