# Vendored dependencies

This directory exists to support offline builds for the `make run` (ninja+kotlinc) toolchain.

Generated by:

```bash
make vendor-deps
```

To include DB dependencies too:

```bash
make vendor-deps VENDOR_INCLUDE_DB=1
```

Contents:

- `jars/` vendored Maven jars (including transitives)
- `maven.classpath` `:`-separated classpath pointing at `jars/`
- `SHA256SUMS` sha256 checksums for the vendored jars
- `deps.coords` the requested Maven coordinates (one per line)

Offline usage:

```bash
make run
```

By default, the Makefile will use these vendored deps when `vendor/maven.classpath` exists.
To force downloads, use `KT_OFFLINE=0`. To require no downloads, use `KT_OFFLINE=1`.
